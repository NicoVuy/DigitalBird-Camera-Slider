update 6.05 Fixed a bug where shutter speed was not being respected in time-lapse mode
update 6.04: Fixes a bug where Ease values were not being updated correctly
update 6.03 adds a new funtion "All To Pose" to the PTZ menu. This allows you to have all cameras move to the current pose/preset number at the same time with one button press.


There are three possible 2.8" Nextion displays that can be used by the system BASIC, DISCOVERY, ENHANCED
Thay can be identified from the colour of the PCB board on the display.
Blue-Basic
Orange-Discovery
Black- Enhanced

For our purposes they all work the same but the firmware requires you install for the specific model
Hense the reason there are three Nextion files here
