This update fixes a bug preventing the VISCA base from connecting with the network due to the IP address being intermitantly scrambled.
I have also updated the software in line with the new PTZplus WIFI controller update which now allows for controlling 4 camera systems
and 9 position presets per camera system. The software has also been updated to allow for VISCA preset speed commands which can be altered from some wired PTZ controllers for example the PTZoptics Superjoy.
