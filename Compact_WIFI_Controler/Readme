There are three possible 2.8" Nextion displays that can be used by the system BASIC, DISCOVERY, ENHANCED
Thay can be identified from the colour of the PCB board on the display.
Blue-Basic
Orange-Discovery
Black- Enhanced

For our purposes thay all work the same But the firmware requires you install for the specific model
Hense the reason there are three Nextion files here

The ESP32 file here is for the ESP32 feather
